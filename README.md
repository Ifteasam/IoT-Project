IR Sensor Project (Arduino):
This project employs an IR sensor to detect objects within its proximity. When an object is detected, the sensor triggers an output pin, allowing for various applications such as proximity sensing or object tracking.

LDR Sensor Project (Arduino):
In this project, an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor is utilized to monitor changes in ambient light levels. The sensor controls an LED, facilitating automatic adjustments in lighting based on the surrounding illumination.

Voice Control Project (Arduino):
Utilizing voice commands, this project enables users to control lights and fans without physical interaction. A microcontroller processes incoming voice commands through a serial connection, executing corresponding actions such as turning devices on or off.

Rain Alarm Project (Arduino):
Designed to enhance safety during heavy rainfall, this project integrates a water sensor to detect rain intensity. When significant rainfall is detected, a buzzer alarm is activated, providing an early warning system for potential flooding or water damage.

Ultrasonic Sensor Project (Arduino):
This project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances and detect objects within a specified range. Upon detecting an object within the predefined distance threshold, a buzzer alarm is triggered, indicating the opening of a door or the presence of an obstruction.

Gas Sensor Project (Arduino):
Focused on gas leak detection, this project incorporates a gas sensor to identify gas concentrations exceeding predefined thresholds. Upon detection, the system triggers alarms such as a buzzer and LED indicator to alert occupants and ensure prompt safety measures.

Android-based Home Automation System:
This comprehensive project enables users to control various home appliances and devices using an Android application. Offering convenient remote access and automation functionalities, the system enhances home comfort and efficiency through seamless integration with smart technology.
